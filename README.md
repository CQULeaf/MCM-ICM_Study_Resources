# MCM-ICM-Custom-Preparation

This repository was created to collect the materials during our preparation period for the MCM/ICM. All the materials are custom and all the efforts are from **Xuhang Ye (captain, programmer)**, **Yuxi Qin (modeler)**, **Yuqiang Zhu (writer)**.

Welcome to our repository dedicated to our preparation for the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) and the Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). The materials found here are custom-crafted with dedication and represent our collective effort during our preparation phase.

The team behind this collection comprises:

- **Xuhang Ye**, who took on the dual roles of captain and programmer.
- **Yuxi Qin**, our expert modeler.
- **Yuqiang Zhu**, the writer responsible for articulating our thoughts and strategies.

Our aim in curating and sharing these materials is to offer a comprehensive resource for those preparing for the MCM/ICM, encapsulating the techniques, strategies, and insights we've gleaned during our journey. Each piece of content here, from study notes to sample problems, is a testament to our team's dedication and hard work. We hope that this repository serves not only as a testament to our journey but also as a valuable tool for others on a similar path.
