# Different Emphases when reading papers

## For programmer

1. **Model Implementation**:
   - **Complexity**: Observe how teams have translated mathematical models into algorithms. How have they handled complex or non-trivial implementations?
   - **Tools & Software**: Which programming languages, libraries, or tools did they use? Familiarity with popular tools like MATLAB, Python (with libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, pandas), or specialized software can be beneficial.
   - **Optimization**: If optimization techniques were used, how were they implemented? This includes linear and non-linear programming, genetic algorithms, or any other optimization method.

2. **Data Handling**:
   - **Data Sources**: Notice where teams get their data. Real-world problems often require real-world data, and understanding where to obtain and how to use this data is essential.
   - **Data Processing**: Pay attention to how they clean, preprocess, and structure the data for their models. Efficient data processing can sometimes make or break a solution.

3. **Validation & Verification**:
   - **Testing Methods**: How did they validate their models? This could involve using a subset of data to validate predictions or comparing model outputs against known benchmarks.
   - **Sensitivity Analysis**: Observe if and how they conducted sensitivity analyses. This involves tweaking parameters or inputs slightly and observing how much the outputs change. This helps in understanding the robustness of the model.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Tools and techniques they used to visualize their results. Good visualization can make complex results understandable.
   - As a programmer, you may be responsible for creating charts, graphs, or even interactive visuals.

5. **Scalability & Efficiency**:
   - How scalable are their solutions? If the problem size increased by a factor of 10 or 100, would their approach still work?
   - Efficiency is crucial, especially if simulations or iterative methods are used. Any note on execution times, memory usage, or other performance metrics can be enlightening.

6. **Documentation & Presentation**:
   - Even though this is more of a concern for writers, understanding how O-prize teams document their code, algorithms, and technical processes can help your team immensely. A well-documented approach is easier for judges to understand and appreciate.
   - Notice how they integrate the narrative with the technical aspects. This helps in understanding how to blend your code's outputs (tables, graphs, results) into the report seamlessly.

7. **Innovation & Creativity**:
   - One key aspect of the O-prize papers is the innovative ways teams approach problems. While this is not strictly a programming concern, understanding creative solutions can inspire you when you face roadblocks or challenges.

## For Modeler

1. **Problem Formulation**:
   - **Understanding the Question**: How did the teams dissect the given problem statement? What assumptions did they make to simplify the problem without losing its essence?
   - **Scope**: Determine the boundaries of their models. What did they include, and what did they decide to omit? Why?

2. **Modeling Approach**:
   - **Type of Model**: Did they use deterministic or stochastic models? Continuous or discrete models? Was it a differential equation, a statistical model, a simulation, or something else?
   - **Complexity vs. Simplicity**: Some O-prize solutions are notable for their elegance and simplicity, while others might be intricate. Understanding when to aim for each can be key.
   - **Assumptions**: Always check the assumptions made and their justifications. Every model rests on assumptions, but they should be reasonable and well-explained.

3. **Model Refinement**:
   - How did they refine or iterate their models? Did they start with a basic version and add layers of complexity, or did they refine by simplifying an initially complex model?

4. **Validation & Verification**:
   - **Comparison with Real Data**: How did their model predictions compare with real-world data or benchmarks?
   - **Sensitivity Analysis**: As mentioned earlier, it's essential to understand how small changes in input affect the outputs. This sheds light on the model's robustness and potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Limitations**: Every model has limitations. Pay attention to how teams acknowledge and address the limitations of their models.

5. **Scalability & Generality**:
   - **Broad Application**: Does the model apply only to the specific scenario given, or can it be applied more broadly to other similar problems or different conditions?
   - **Parameterization**: How easily can parameters be changed to adapt the model to different situations?

6. **Interdisciplinary Insight**:
   - Since the ICM often involves problems that bridge various disciplines, see how teams integrated knowledge from different fields into their mathematical models.

7. **Critical Thinking & Justification**:
   - Pay attention to the reasoning behind their choices. Why did they opt for one modeling technique over another? What trade-offs did they consider?

8. **Results & Conclusions**:
   - Look at the conclusions drawn from the models. Are they definitive, or do they offer a range of possibilities? How did they interpret their results in the context of the original problem?

9. **Innovation & Creativity**:
   - As with the programmer's perspective, notice the innovative techniques or approaches the team used. Were there any unique methods or perspectives that set their model apart?

## For writer

1. **Clarity & Structure**:
   - **Organization**: How is the paper structured? Look at how they've ordered their introduction, problem formulation, model description, results, and conclusions.
   - **Logical Flow**: Are ideas presented in a logical sequence? Does one section build on the previous one, leading the reader smoothly through the solution process?

2. **Introduction & Motivation**:
   - **Setting the Stage**: How effectively do they introduce the problem? Does the introduction provide enough context and background?
   - **Problem Importance**: How do they convey the significance of the problem they're tackling? Why should the reader care?

3. **Language & Tone**:
   - **Technical vs. Layman's Terms**: While the paper is for a technical audience, observe how they explain complex concepts. Is there a balance between technical jargon and layman's terms?
   - **Engagement**: Are there elements in their writing that engage the reader? This could be through real-world implications, anecdotes, or other narrative techniques.

4. **Visual Aids**:
   - **Graphs, Charts & Diagrams**: How effectively do they use visual aids to supplement the text? Are the visuals clear, labeled, and referenced appropriately in the text?
   - **Model Visualization**: If applicable, how do they visualize their mathematical model? Is it intuitive and easy to understand?

5. **Explanation of Assumptions & Choices**:
   - **Rationale**: How do they justify the assumptions they made in their model? Are reasons given for choosing one method or approach over another?

6. **Results Presentation**:
   - **Clarity**: Are results presented clearly and systematically? 
   - **Interpretation**: Beyond just presenting results, how effectively do they interpret them in the context of the problem?

7. **Conclusion & Recommendations**:
   - **Summarizing**: How do they wrap up their findings? Does the conclusion revisit the main points made throughout the paper?
   - **Future Work**: Do they provide recommendations for future research or potential improvements to their model?

8. **Abstract or Executive Summary**:
   - Often, the first thing judges read is the abstract or summary. How effectively does it capture the essence of the paper? Does it give a clear overview of the problem, approach, and main findings?

9. **Citations & References**:
   - How do they incorporate external sources? Are references cited appropriately, giving credit where it's due?

10. **Grammar & Syntax**:

    - While it might seem basic, proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation are crucial for a polished paper. Observe the quality of the writing in these aspects.
